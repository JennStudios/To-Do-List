                                	[Story Board]
[===========================================================================================]

Prologue: 
	
  	Rolling slides with exposition briefly describing collective belief, integration, meta humanity, 
  	and then pivot to a faceless character handed a manilla folder with META clearly written.
  
  	Opening Cut Scene, drone-like footage of Ground City that slowly approaches concrete building, inside
  	Jennifer with a hardhat and high vis vest, opening credits roll, Jen clocks out and begins to descend the building
  
  	Tipzl sits at a computer with the monitor obscuring her face below the eyes, blue light reflecting on skin, typing
  
  	Hatman recieves the manilla folder 
  
  	Music should be somewhat upbeat for beginning of the game but with a quiet sad undertone

Act 1: 
	J&T's Apartment Number (41) shown, knock at the door, Jen opens the door to find estrogen vials and some pamphlets,
	J talks to T, J describes the doomer pamphlets left by their dealer (hatman) and Tipzl anxiously describes 
	panic by trans people on "the board/sub" including an instance of police brutality, 
	crash is heard outside, J&T look out their apartment window, Aphie's head is crushed by a police cruiser, 
	J&T hear banging at their door, radio static and muttering can be heard indicating it is the police,
	J&T flee down their fire escape, J&T inspect the car of the car victim, find vials of estrogen, they find the 
	ID of Aphie, J grabs T and flees down nearby alley becaues the police cruiser that ran over
	Aphie has returned to the scene, J&T talk, J says they should go to Club Androlyte to look for Hatman or place to 
	hide. 
  
  	Players are dropped into the over world. 
  
  	Tool tips will explain the dysphoria bar as a combined Health bar and Sanity Meter, inventory, character screen, 
  	World Map Cope Toggles, Fishing & Foraging
  
  	First enemies the players encounter are police dogs which acts as a combat tutorial. Combat plays like Final 
  	Fantasy 1-6. Tipzl will refuse to harm animals and won't kill Humans/animals in the first 4 acts
  
  	J&T will share some short commentary on enemies the first time they defeat them 
  
  	Tipzl will occasionally chime in asking Jen where they're going if they go too far from Club Androlyte
