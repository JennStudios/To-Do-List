This is my to-do list so people can see what's planned, what I've done, and also 
get an idea for the state of the game. 

The version of this file will be updated when I finish the batch of what's on the 
to do list. So like everything you see here was added with v.0.0.2 and after
every single thing is done, I will add things to the To-Do section (denoted
below as act 1.) When I do it will be updated to 0.0.3. This version isn't
insignificant. The 0s represent which phase of development the to-do list
is in. First zero is beta, second 0 is alpha, third is pre-alpha (we are here.)

Pre-alpha means the game is still deep in the production stage. Assets like
art, music, animations, tile sets, maps, gui, etc. are still having
their foundations made. Over time, and as we move to alpha (testing unstable
builds to get data and feed back to improve for different hardware and stuff)

Alpha is not really a game release even though it is play testing the 
earliest versions of the game. The point is to make sure the game is stable,
that menus and controls work, and towards the end of alpha will be building 
ontop of the foundations laid in alpha and pre-alpha. 

Beta is most analogous to early access. The core of the game is finished 
and the rest is being fleshed out. Testing complicated systems. Polishing the
game. Beta is the last phase before official release.

===================[Story Board]====================

Prologue: 
	
   Rolling slides with exposition briefly describing collective belief, integration, 
   meta humanity, and then pivot to a faceless character handed a manilla folder with META 
   clearly written.

  Opening Cut Scene, drone-like footage of Ground City that slowly approaches concrete building
  inside Jennifer with a hardhat and high vis vest, she joins two large SCR wire together,
  electricity arcs and they are soldered together, opening credits roll, Jen clocks out and 
  begins to descend the building

  Tipzl sits at a computer with the monitor obscuring her face below the eyes, blue light 
  reflecting on skin, typing. Her augmented reality glasses with a graph of data playing 
  out right to left over her eye, allowing her to quickly parse data from what she is reading.
  Tipzl looks at the camera and smiles.

  Transitioning to a bar scene with a haze of smoke covers a dimly lit room where dark
  and neon lights illuminate it.

  Contrasted with these happier scenes before the music will dip in pitch and tone showing
  Hatman recieving the manilla folder from an unnamed woman. 
  
  He takes a quick look at it, his eyes scanning the page, and his eyes widen expressing
  concern.
  
  Cross fade transition to Hatman, katana swaying on one side of his hips, and couple of
  guns on the other and a back pack on. He runs through an wet alleyway splashing up water with
  each step. A vial of liquid falls out of his bag and rolls down a street drain. The camera 
  follows it into the undercity. It rolls past several doors before stopping in front of a 
  door with a sign that says Sulfuric Acid. Foreshadowing the water treatment facility the
  players visit in act 3. The door and wall fade and change to an apartment door. 
  Apartment 41.
  
  Music should be somewhat upbeat for beginning of the game but with a quiet sad undertone



Act 1:

  J&T's Apartment Number (41) shown, knock at the door, Jen opens the door to find 
  estrogen vials and some pamphlets, J talks to T, J describes the doomer pamphlets left 
  by their dealer (hatman) and Tipzl anxiously describes panic by trans people on 
  "the board/sub" including an instance of police brutality, crash is heard outside, 
  J&T look out their apartment window, Aphie's head is crushed by a police cruiser, 
  J&T hear banging at their door, radio static and muttering can be heard indicating 
  it is the police, J&T flee down their fire escape, J&T inspect the car of the car victim,
  find vials of estrogen, they find the ID of Aphie, J grabs T and flees down nearby 
  alley becaues the police cruiser that ran over Aphie has returned to the scene, J&T talk,
  J says they should go to Club Androlyte to look for Hatman or place to hide. 

  Players are dropped into the over world. 

  Tool tips will explain the dysphoria bar as a combined Health bar and Sanity Meter, 
  inventory, character screen, World Map Cope Toggles, Fishing & Foraging

  First enemies the players encounter are police dogs which acts as a combat tutorial. 
  Combat plays like Final Fantasy 1-6. Tipzl will refuse to harm animals and won't kill
  Humans/animals in the first 4 acts

  J&T will share some short commentary on enemies the first time they defeat them 

  Tipzl will occasionally chime in asking Jen where they're going if they go too far from 
  in the wrong direction from Club Androlyte

  When the players reach Club Androlyte another cutscene, taking place at their apartment,
  will play these are the beginning of the [Agent Cutscenes]

[Agent Cutscene 1]: 
	After Jen and tipzl flee the apartment and inspect the corpse of aphie and flee down
  an alleyway and set out to look for hatman, the police will break down their apartment door and the 
  agents will emerge from them and inspect the room, finding the doomer pamphlets hatman gave to the pair
  with their final estrogen delivery. Agent 1 will show Agent 2 and in the background the Agent 3 will look 
  out the window.

  Throughout act one the agents will be following Jen and Tipzl acting as a specific threat they're unaware of.

	What the players should be wondering is how the agents or general police forces knew that meta humans 
  lived in apartment 41 and how much they know  about their targets. While the players will encounter random 
  police forces throughout the game the agents are a seemingly unstoppable force specifically tracking them 
  through the world. The agent's perspective of following the player characters will also contrast the things the 
  characters are doing and their decisions.

===================[Meta Details Continued]====================

Because I actually want to sell this game (prolly like $5 idk yet, I want to make the
publishing fee for steam back ($100)) it will be a closed beta. People getting in
during pre-alpha will always be considered first for testing.  I will also be handing
out a number of free keys to select communities which have supported, encouraged, and 
inspired my love to work on this game. 

So far these communities include:
Bodhi Linux - 5-10 keys
Fedora Lxde users - 5-10 keys
4ran/ttttrans - 20 keys given out to prealpha frens / 10 keys for the sub
		maybe a handful for the board idk

Pre-alpha and alpha testers will recieve special roles in the disc and these 
roles define the volunteer credit (meaning you are unpaid volunteers) in
the closing credits of the game.
